RWMS (RimWorldModSorter) changelog:
0.95.1 (2019-08-17):
fixed:
- fix for the windows people, binary should do its thing now.

0.95.0 (2019-08-17):
maintenance release, bugfixes
new:
- added custom parameters to shell scripts for passing through.
- all values from the configuration file are available as command line switches
  (except github username and password).

changed:
- re-added some delays to script for better readability of output, is configurable.
- updated documentation to reflect changes.
- RWMS now waits on errors (optionally if possible).
- some internal code refactoring.

fixed:
- make shell scripts runnable from every directory (Ibmaian).
- wait_on_error configuration value was mostly ignored.

0.94.9 (2019-07-30):
bugfix release
fixed:
- show relative paths for local unknown mods in the unknown mods report
- ensure unknown mod report and ModConfig.xml backup have the same timestamp in the name (in the very rare case that the minute changes during the script)

internal code fixes:
- use tuples instead of lists for fixed sized objects
- move unknown mod handling in load_mod_data outside to avoid side effects in it
- use os.path.join in another place
- remove unnecessary file.close() after with statements, since the with statements guarantee it's already called

Big thank you to Ibmaian!

0.94.8 (2019-07-26):
new:
- build script for windows executable

changed:
- improved mod name cleaner
- 7zip support for build script (thanks Ibmaian)
- 7zip support improvements in build script
- re-added windows binary executable in release
- improved configuration dump, checks now validity of paths
- improved documentation
- pretty print ModsConfig.xml (thanks Ibmaian)

fixed:
- crash on empty ModsConfig.xml
- several small internal cosmetic and lint fixes (thanks Ibmaian)
- fix for older Python versions (thanks Rocketeer999)
- unknown, ACTIVE mods are now not removed anymore (thanks Ibmaian), you can enable / disable this behaviour with
  the dontremoveunknown switch in the configuration file, which already existed, but did not do the correct thing(tm).
  Default is keeping them.


0.94.7 (2019-06-30):
changed:
- RimWorld release names and mod versions are now filtered out in order to curb the need to add a duplicate
  database entry for the new mod version of the same mod.

  This also means that the current database format has been slightly tweaked and older versions of RWMS than 0.94.7
  will likely produce bunch of false unknown mods. This cannot be avoided.

  You should upgrade.

- configuration dump has been adjusted.

0.94.6 (2019-05-18):
new:
- added requirement.txt and install-requirements script for easier installation needed modules.

changed:
- fixes for Steam autodetection on Windows.
- added proper Steam detection for Linux and OSX (thanks jpc0)
- more flexible start for rwms_sort.sh (thanks jpc0)
- internal structure, refactoring for easier source code management.

0.94.5 (2019-05-14):
fixed:
- RimWorld version detection in ModsConfig.xml

0.94.4 (2019-05-10):
new:
- new command line option "--dump-configuration", dumps the current configuration RWMS has itself configured,
  same as "python rimworld_configuration.py"

0.94.3 (2019-05-08):
new:
- new configuration option "dontremoveunknown": do not remove unknown mods (and stick them at the bottom of the list)
- new command line parser, try --help
- new command line option "--disable-steam", overrides same configuration file setting
- new command line option "--dont-remove-unknown-mods", overrides same configuration file setting
- new command line option "--reset-to-core", resets ModsConfig.xml to Core only (idea taken from Mehni's tool)
- documentation added

changed:
- "contributors" command line option changed to "--contributors" (new parser)
- small delays removed.

fixed:
- configuration directive "openbrowser_on_update" works now.
- minor XML fix, empty li-element removed in ModsConfig.xml


0.94.2 (2019-05-04):
changed:
- changed unknown data file format slightly for easier processing.

0.94.1 (2019-05-04):
new:
- asks if script may open a new browser window to RWMSDB issues tracker if unknown mods are detected.
- table of contents in documentation.
- added documentation about contents of the unknown data file which is generated for submission.

changed:
- reworked data format for unknown mods file, now has versioning, some meta information about installation
  and Steam Workshop links to mods if steam support is not disabled. Reason for including this meta information
  is relieving me from the guesswork of the installation I'm already doing if I have to pinpoint bugs.
- reworked script output wording and flow a bit.
- automatically sanitize contributor name, if an email address is provided. I already did this manually in the
  unknown mod submissions.

Concerning the inclusion of the operating system metadata in the unknown mods file:
This will only include the output of the Python "sys.platform" call, which will produce "darwin", "win32" or "linux".
Please refer to the documentation page https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html#sys.platform for more details.
If I need more platform-specific details, I will ask directly in the issue / forum.

0.94.0 (2019-04-25):
new:
- automatic issue creation, if you put in your Github credentials in the configuration file.

changed:
- reworked output on the command line, now leaner, less scroll and (hopefully) more informative.
- updated documentation, especially the configuration file
- reworked changelog (you are reading this)
- (2019-04-26) documentation changes regarding module requirements, nothing new to the code itself.

fixed:
- several fatal errors did not honor the waitforkeypress_on_error in the configuration file.

Note that I am aware that there is also a token / OAuth system available for the GitHub API, but I could
not get it to work with just having access to issues. If you have a workable solution (in Python 3), please
contact me.


0.93.2 (2019-04-23):
new:
- added contribution breakdown with "contributors" command line argument.
